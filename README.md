# Plasmic Website - Work in progress

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-plasmic-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-plasmic-app).
krweb.plasmic.run for a demo of the website. Beware, it might run a little slow as it’s only for temporary use and runs on plasmic servers. Future work might include importing react components and deploying them to Cercel.

Mobile Use is not available at the moment.

## Homepage

The homepage boasts a sleek, modern design utilizing Plasmic's built-in features, including a spinning image within a container. An example video is displayed to showcase Plasmic's video embedding capabilities. The remainder of the page provides links to other sections of the site
